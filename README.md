# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset containing transaction records. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with significantly more non-fraudulent transactions than fraudulent ones, making traditional evaluation metrics like accuracy less effective. The focus is on metrics like **Sensitivity** (True Positive Rate) and **Specificity** (True Negative Rate), with the goal of maximizing the ability to detect fraudulent transactions (high sensitivity).

## Introduction
Fraud detection is critical for financial institutions to minimize losses from unauthorized transactions. In this project, we build multiple machine learning models to predict fraud based on past transaction data. Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, we emphasize true positive detection through models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn`
  - `warnings`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the `creditcard.csv` file, containing the following fields:
- **Time**: Number of seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction.
- **V1-V28**: Principal components obtained using PCA.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **Class**: Binary label where 1 represents fraud and 0 represents non-fraud.

No null values were found in the dataset. The dataset is highly imbalanced with only 52 fraud cases out of 11959 total records.

## Modeling and Evaluation
Three machine learning models were used:
1. **Random Forest**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Tree**

The data was split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split, and the models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Sensitivity**: To detect as many fraudulent transactions as possible.
- **Specificity**: To minimize false positives (incorrectly flagged legitimate transactions).

## Results
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: 99.94%
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 99.83%
- **Decision Tree Accuracy**: Pending.

Although accuracy is high due to imbalanced data, sensitivity and specificity are more important for evaluating the model's true performance.
